        <p>Like HTML, CSS is not a programming language. It's not a markup language either. CSS is a style sheet
            language. CSS is what you use to selectively style HTML elements. For example, this CSS selects paragraph
            text, setting the color to red:
        </p> <!-- 10 total, p:1-->
        <code> {
            color: red;
            }</code><!--user story #6; need 5 total-->
        <p>Let's try it out! Using a text editor, paste the three lines of CSS (above) into a new file. Save the file as
            style.css in a directory named styles.

            To make the code work, we still need to apply this CSS (above) to your HTML document. Otherwise, the styling
            won't change the appearance of the HTML. (If you haven't been following our project, pause here to read
            Dealing with files and HTML basics.)

        </p>
        <ol>


            <li>Open your index.html file. Paste the following line in the head (between the &lt head> and &lt/head>
                tags):
            </li>
            <code>&lt link href="styles/style.css" rel="stylesheet"></code>
            <li>Save index.html and load it in your browser. You should see something like this:</li>

        <h2>
            Selector
        </h2>
        <p>
            This is the HTML element name at the start of the ruleset. It defines the element(s) to be styled (in this
            example, &lt p &gt elements). To style a different element, change the selector.
        </p>
        <h2>
            Declaration
        </h2>
        <p>
            This is a single rule like <code>color: red;</code>. It specifies which of the element's properties you want
            to style.
        </p>
        <h2>
            Properties
        </h2>
        <p>
            These are ways in which you can style an HTML element. (In this example, <code> color</code> is a property
            of the &lt p &gt elements.) In CSS, you choose which properties you want to affect in the rule.
        </p>
        <h2>
            Property value
        </h2>
        <p>
            To the right of the property—after the colon—there is the property value. This chooses one out of many
            possible appearances for a given property. (For example, there are many <code>color</code> values in
            addition to <code> red</code>.)
        </p>
        <p>
            Note the other important parts of the syntax:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Apart from the selector, each ruleset must be wrapped in curly braces. ({})</li>
            <li>Within each declaration, you must use a colon (:) to separate the property from its value or values.
            </li>
            <li>Within each ruleset, you must use a semicolon (;) to separate each declaration from the next one.</li>
        </ul>

    </section>
    <section id="Selecting_multiple_elements" class="main-section">
        <header>Selecting multiple elements</header>
        <p>
            You can also select multiple elements and apply a single ruleset to all of them. Separate multiple selectors
            by commas. For example:
        </p>
        <code>
            p, li, h1 {
            color: red;
            }
        </code>

    <section id="Different_types_of_selectors" class="main-section">
        <header>Different types of selectors</header>
        <p>
            There are many different types of selectors. The examples above use element selectors, which select all
            elements of a given type. But we can make more specific selections as well. Here are some of the more common
            types of selectors:

        </p>

        <p>
            There are many more selectors to discover. To learn more, see the MDN <a
                href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Guide/CSS/Getting_started/Selectors">Selectors

        <p>
            Now that we've explored some CSS fundamentals, let's improve the appearance of the example by adding more
            rules and information to the style.css fil
        </p>
        <ol>
            <li>First, find the output from Google Fonts that you previously saved from What will your website look
                like?. Add the link element somewhere inside your index.html's head (anywhere between the head and /head
                tags). It looks something like this:
                <br>
                <code>
                    &lt link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans" rel="stylesheet" &gt
                </code></li>
            <li> Next, delete the existing rule you have in your style.css file. It was a good test, but let's not
                continue with lots of red text.
            </li>
            <li> Add the following lines (shown below), replacing the font-family assignment with your font-family
                selection from What will your website look like?. The property font-family refers to the font(s) you
                want to use for text. This rule defines a global base font and font size for the whole page. Since &lt
                html &gt is the parent element of the whole page, all elements inside it inherit the same font-size and
                font-family.<br><code>html {
                    font-size: 10px; /* px means "pixels": the base font size is now 10 pixels high */
                    font-family: "Open Sans", sans-serif; /* this should be the rest of the output you got from Google
                    fonts */
                    }</code></li>
            <li>Note: Anything in CSS between /* and */ is a CSS comment. The browser ignores comments as it renders the
                code. CSS comments are a way for you to write helpful notes about your code or logic.
            </li>
            <li>Now let's set font sizes for elements that will have text inside the HTML body. We'll also center the
                heading. Finally, let's expand the second ruleset (below) with settings for line height and letter
                spacing to make body content more readable.
            </li>
        </ol>
        <p>
            Adjust the px values as you like. Your work-in-progress should look similar to this:
        </p>
    </section>
</main>
</body>
</html>
